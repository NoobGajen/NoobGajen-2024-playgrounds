## Chapter 1: Picking a Bug Bounty Program

* What is an asset? An attack surface?
* What is a social site? What are two major ways they present vulnerabilities?
* What is triage? What are some popular BB platforms? Did you visit their sites?
* What is scope?
* Metrics for choosing a BB program

### Asset

* An application, website or product you can hack

#### Social Sites and Applications

* Any site that allows users to interact with each other
* lots of potential for vulnerabilities due to complexity of interactions
* either via mismanagement of user-information or lack of validation on user input
* attack surface: application's different points that you can attempt to exploit

#### General Web Applications

* No user-user interactions. Instead user-server interactions to to access app features
* Ex. static sites, cloud applications, consumer services (banking), portals of IoT
* primarily vulnerabilities on server-side + specific to application stack

#### Mobile Applications

* likely need a rooted device, a regular device, and emulators for Android and iOS
* more complex setup and likely less competitive

#### APIs

* specification on how other programs interact with an organization's assets
* good APIs are key to protecting customer data
* same skillset as web-hacking

#### Source Code and Executables

* once you have more experience reverse engineering

#### Hardare and IoT

* even more specialized. might have to buy your own hardware

### Bug Bounty Programs

* Bounty either via BB Platforms or via independent sites
* BB examples: Bugcrowd, HackerOne, Intigriti, Synack, and Cobalt
* Search by _Company Name Bug Bounty Program_ for independent sites
* Triage: confirmation of vulnerability

#### Pros

* more transparent on amount payed, past reports, response times
* less hassle of communication with different security teams and duplicating info (tax details)

#### Cons

* some companies aren't on the platform
* chain of communication involves third party triagers who aren't as familiar with the product

### Scope, Payout and Response Times

* What and how are you allowed to attack?
* Scope involves:
  * asset scope: what subdomain, product, and application you can hack
  * vulnerability scope: what vulnerabilities companies will accept as valid bugs
* Payout Amounts: Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP) and Bug Bounty (BB)
* VDPs only pay is swag and reputation

### Private Programs

* Invite only. The best way to get an invite is to find something first
* sometimes possible via completing tutorials or CTFs Tips: Choose something reputed and unpaid with big scopes and supportive team

## Chapter 2: Sustaining your Success

Will primarily skip this chapter because it doesn't provide much technical value. However, this will be helpful as you write reports for BB or for CTFs.

### Writing a good report

#### Craft a Descriptive Title

* DONOT: IDOR on a critical endpoint
* DO: IDOR on http://example.com/change\_password Leads to Account Takeover for All Users

#### Provide a clear summary

* personal pnemonic (but explained in different stages in the book):
* explain the context: what http parameters does the endpoint take?
* explain the discovery: how did you find the vulnerability?
* explain the exploit: how can the exploit be replicated?
* explain the impact: why is the exploit a concern?

#### Include a Severity

* Low: Leads to potential phishing (phishing via open redirect)
* Medium: Impactful with difficult exploitation steps (CSRF on password change)
* High: Impacts a lot of users with disastrous consequences
* Critical: Impacts majority of users as well as organizational infrastructure
* Study CVSS for more: https://first.org/cvss
* Or platform-specific: https://bugcrowd.com/vulnerability-rating-taxonomy/
* https://docs.hackerone.com/hackers/severity.html

#### Give Clear Steps to Reproduce

#### Provide a Proof of Concept

#### Describe the impact and attack Scenarios

#### Recommend possible mitigation

#### Validate your report

### Additional Tips

#### Don't assume anything

* Is it the security team or a developer of a startup reading the report?

#### Be Clear and Concise

* Do not include unnecessary details.

#### Write what you want to read

#### Be Professional

### Building a relationship with the Development Team

#### Understanding Reporting State

* Need More Information
* Informative
* Duplicate
* N/A
* Triaged
* Resolved

#### Dealing With Conflict

#### Building a Partnership

* Read some other reports with the company to understand their communication style

### Understanding Why You're Failing

#### Why you are not finding bugs

* You participate in the wrong programs
* You do not stick to a program
  * Dig Deep or Search Wide
* You do not Recon
* You go for only Low Hanging Fruit
* You do not get into private programs

#### Why your report gets dismissed

* You donot read the bounty policy
* You donot put yourself in the organization's shoes
* You donot chain bugs
* You write bad reports (i.e misplaced severity)
* What about duplicates?

### What to do When you are stuck

* Take a break (rest is where creativity happens)
* Build your skill set (CTFs perhaps?)
* Gain a fresh perspective (diversify, specialize, chain)

## Chapter 3: How the Internet Works

* What is client server model?

### The client-server model

* Client requests the resources, server provides them
* HyperText Markup Language HTML decides where things are located
* Cascading Style Sheets CSS decides what they look like
* Javascript JS decides what they behave like

### Domain Name System DNS

* Computers on the internet have numbers, not names
* We assign names to these numbers using a register called DNS registry
* One computer can have many conversations at the same time. We identify a conversation using a port number.

### HTTP Requests and Responses

* Hyper Text Transfer Protocol carries the requests and reponses
* Requests are in the format:

```http
GET / HTTP/1.1   <- Request Line
Host: www.google.com <- Header to distinguish service
Header: Value (Optional/Others)
```

* HTTP has a verb (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, OPTIONS)
* There are a few common headers:
  * User-Agent: Browser/Curl/Python
  * Accept + Accept-Lanugage + Accept-Encoding: the format the response is expected be in
  * Connection: Should the connection stay open after sending response
  * Authorization: Credentials
  * Cookie: Some info that the server wants to save on client end
* Responses are in the format:

```http
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Header: Value (Optional/Others)
Body
```

* There's a lot more at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Messages

### Internet Security Controls

#### Content Encoding

* Base 64 Encoding: we have covered this before on cryptopals
* URL encoding: not much except using ascii values with a preceeding % ex. %20

#### Session Management and HTTP Cookies

* Why don't you have to relogin everytime?
* Server assigns a session ID then sends it to you as a cookie, which gets resent to server with every request.

#### Token-Based Authentication

* Instead of storing session ID serverside, store this into browsers itself with a digital signature
* JWT is a popular mechanism for it
  * { "alg": "none", "type": "JWT"} {"user": "admin"}
  * attack: manipulating the alg field
  * attack: brute-force the key
  * attack: reading sensitive information

#### The Same Origin Policy

* Same Origin if same protocol, hostname and port number

## Chapter 4: Environmental Setup and Traffic Interception

* Basically install burp and configure firefox to use it
* Learn what Repeater, Decoder, Intruder, Comparer do
* Learn to save burp requests

## Chapter 5: Web Hacking Reconnaissance

* Aka gathering information

### Manually walking through the target

* Click through every page, every feature
* Sign up at each privilege level and interact
* Sign up with different account under same privilege level and interact

### Google Dorking

* practically just advanced google searches with some keywords
* site: show results from a certain site only
* inurl: show pages with url that matches search string (.php?page=)
* intitle: find search string on page's title ("index of")
* link: web pages that contain link to a specific url
* filetype: look for log files, pdf files, image files
* wildcards, minus, or (|), quotes("")

### Scope Discovery

#### WHOIS and Reverse WHOIS

* whois facebook.com
* nslookup facebook.com
* whois 157.240.2.35
* track the AS for the host: whois -h whois.cymru.com 157.240.2.21

#### Certificate Parsing

* Subject Alternative Name: Field has site names that use the same certificate
* with crt.sh

#### Subdomain Enumeration

* sublist3r, subbrute, amass, gobuster
* You might need a list. search for SecLists

#### Service Enumeration

* is a website running on any other port
* active (via your machine) or passive scanning (via a third party)

#### Directory Brute Forcing

* gobuster again

#### Spidering the site

* BurpSuite Crawler
* OWASP ZAP Spider
* Look at a page, go to all the pages that this page links

#### Third Party Hosting

* site:s3.amazonaws.com COMPANY\_NAME
* buckets.grayhatwarefare.com for public buckets
* bruteforce using lazys3 or bucket stream
* use aws cli to interact with the buckets

#### Search the organizations github repo

* Job Postings
* Way Back Machine
* Employeers on LinkedIn, StackOverflow, Quora
* Pastebin and PasteHunter

#### Tech Stack Fingerprinting

* Wapplyzer, BuiltWith, StackShare
