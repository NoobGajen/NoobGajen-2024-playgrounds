# 2. Open Redirect

## How Open Redirects work

* here's a toy example scenario

```bash
https://www.google.com/?redirect_to=https://www.gmail.com
```

where google.com responds with 302 to Location: www.gmail.com However, this make the following possible:

```bash
https://www.google.com/?redirect_to=https://www.attacker.com
```

which might exploit trust and lead to phishing.

* hunting for this kind of bugs:
  * look for url parameters like redirect= or url= or r= or u=
  * look for tags
  * look for window.location(.href|.replace) within javascript code
