# Ramping Up

## LEVEL 1: DETACH YOâ€™ HEAD

To complete this level, let's detach HEAD from `bugFix` and attach it to the commit instead.\
Specify this commit by its hash. The hash for each commit is displayed on the circle that represents the commit.\


The command is\


```sh
    git checkout C4
```

## LEVEL 2: RELATIVE REFS (^)

Relative commits are powerful, but we will introduce two simple ones here: - Moving upwards one commit at a time with `^` - Moving upwards a number of times with `~<num>` To complete this level, check out the parent commit of `bugFix`. This will detach `HEAD`.\
The command is

```sh
    git checkout C3
```

## LEVEL 3: RELATIVE REFS #2 (\~)

The \~ operator\
You can directly reassign a branch to a commit with the `-f` option. So something like:\
`git branch -f main HEAD~3`\
The commands I used the first time to solve are

```sh
    git checkout C4
    git branch -f main HEAD~2
    git checkout C5
    git branch -f bugFix HEA~3
    git checkout C1
    git branch -f main C6
```

## LEVEL 4 : Reversing Changes in Git

There are two primary ways to undo changes in Git -- one is using `git reset` and the other is using `git revert`.\
To complete this level, reverse the most recent commit on both `local` and `pushed`. You will revert two commits total (one per branch).\
`git reset` works as in the commit never happened. `git reset HEAD~1 git revert HEAD`\
The commands are :

```sh
    git reset HEAD~1
    git checkout pushed
    git revert pushed
```
